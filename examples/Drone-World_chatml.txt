<|im_start|>Narrator
I lived in the safest city in the world … until I tried to leave it.
I could sense the machine on the other side as the ceiling creaked above my head. The metal drone was searching for my body signature. Finding me was its reward. It had been hours since I escaped but it was only moments before it would find me. It’s impossible to hide in the city. It’s for our own safety, but a warden says the same thing to his prisoners.
A metallic scratch warned me that the drone had turned the corner of the exterior wall. It would look for a point of weakness, find an opening into the building and break through. I moved, realizing that although a sound would alert it to my location, staying still was no longer an option. I scurried around some boxes, heading down to the stairs. I had to cover a lot of distance in a short time. My Dad always teased me that I ran around like my life depended on it.
For once, he was right.
The stairs squeaked beneath my weight. It wasn’t loud, but to a drone it might have sounded like an elephant stomping. The scratching outside stopped. Normally I would have taken that as a good sign, but now I ran. Hard. As I hit the bottom landing, a cutting sound reverberated from the left wall and sparks flashed in the shadows. Sunlight streamed through the crack; I had seen little of it since my base was a windowless room. But I had no time to admire the sun as a red eye gleamed in the hole. In my hesitation, I saw my reflection in its eyes and the drone registered my presence. Once it saw me, then potentially dozens more would be alerted to my presence.
I slid down the stairs like a fire pole. If I tripped now, I was done. If I didn’t get away from this drone quickly, I was done as well. What a lovely set of options. Boards splintered and cracked from the floor above; the drone had finally entered the building.
Drones come in all shapes and sizes. This one resembled a bumblebee, small, fast and lethal. Once it sees you, you can’t outrun it. It flies through the air at 20 kilometres an hour, and no matter how fast a runner you are, it never slows down. You’re only hope is to find obstacles — doors, walls, cars — anything that blocks you from their view. But once it locks onto you, it is only a matter of time before it catches you. The damn things never stop.
I was so exhausted from the day’s escape. I would die to rest for just five minutes. The truth was harsher; if I rested for five seconds now, it would be a permanent sleep. A board snapped under my feet, almost wrenching my ankle with my forward momentum. The building was condemned, and with every step I could see why. The structure had four levels, deep in the bowels of the city. The building was made of rusted steel, well past its expiry date.
A red beam flashed from above, its searchlight inspecting the corners of the room. My feet hit the bottom level. I had run out of space, and going back the same way was not an option.
I was frustrated. It’s funny what emotions take hold when you are about to die. How has this drone found me? I was so careful to stay hidden! Taking all the precautions, using several disguises, and avoiding the cameras. What did I do wrong?
Interrupting my thoughts, my foot hit a metal ring. I stooped down, thinking I had found a handle to help my escape. Instead, I triggered a trap as the floor collapsed and I fell into a watery grave.
That was when my world ended.
I was halfway between the sensation of falling and floating. Warm air blew through my hair. The ground was far below but never seemed to get closer. Every few moments, a gust of wind would blow me higher. I felt like a bird, but I had no wings, no way to propel myself. I was like a feather in the wind floating aimlessly with the currents. I reached up to touch the clouds, and my hand became moist as water droplets appeared on my fingers. I wanted to go higher, to break free of the earth. Heck I just wanted to go anywhere. To see the world. Leave the city.
My eyes opened and my dream was over. I stared up at the ceiling, wondering what I was becoming. I had been dreaming a lot lately, sometimes during school, which always got me in trouble. It’s not like I’m depressed; I have friends, my Dad and a home. It’s not like I lived on the streets. I just always felt like there was more to life outside our city’s walls. Our super-safe city, no crime, no trouble, nothing out of the ordinary. Adults told me that we were lucky to live in a place where everyone was so safe. So B-O-R-I-N-G! I pushed up on my arms, turned my head and looked out the window.
A star shone, glowing twice as bright as any other object. Like my dream, I wished I could fly up to it. Grab a hold of it and explore its surface. I felt confined in the city and I would do just about anything to get out of there.
It was early; the glow on the horizon meant the sun was about to rise. There was no sense in going back to sleep. My Dad would be up soon, and he made enough noise for ten people. I’m sure he didn’t mean to, it’s just that he had two left feet. And two left hands. But I still loved him.
I slid of out bed, grabbed a towel and headed to the shower. Maybe if I get an early start to my day, I can walk through the Marks before school. I undressed, turned on the shower and stepped in. The water was warm as it cascaded down my back. It was one of the few moments of the day when I thought about absolutely nothing. My Dad always yelled at me for spending so long in the shower that when I came out I looked like a prune. I squeezed my face together in my hands and looked in the mirror. I looked old and wrinkly.
I pushed open the shower door and grabbed my towel. I wiped my fingers over the steamy mirror. My hair looked dull and lifeless, a wet mop. No matter what I did with it, it just never came out the way I wanted. That applied to just about everything in my life. No matter how hard I tried to study, I was never a top student. Worked my butt off for sports, always second line at best. Tried to be popular, never got into the in-crowd. Maybe that was why I had such a desire to get out of the city, in hopes that I would be special elsewhere.
I threw on a sweatshirt, pulled on my jeans and grabbed my knapsack. I hoped to grab some breakfast and get out of the house before Dad woke up. No such luck.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“You’re up early. Big test today?” I turned around and saw Dad reading the paper on his tablet. It was a soft question but I knew he was probing. He couldn’t help himself; he was senior counsel, an attorney with the government. Putting away the guilty — like there was anyone innocent in our court system. Everything we discussed was like a cross-examination and lasted at least twenty questions. Sometimes he asked the same question several times but changed the wording slightly, hoping to catch me in a lie. I didn’t take it personally — it was what he did for a living. I had to nip this in the bud.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“School project. Hoping to spend some time at the lab before first period,” I answered nonchalantly as I downed a glass of orange juice.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“Isn’t it easier to do that after school?” he asked and looked away from his tablet while putting down his coffee. Nineteen questions to go.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“Maybe so, but we have softball practice after school. Remember its Wednesday?” I pulled out yogurt and strawberries from the refrigerator and sat down at the table. Nothing better than to follow up a lie with some truth; keeps the suspicious at bay.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“As long as you’re not walking through the Marks on your way to school.” There was his veiled reminder. It didn’t matter if he believed my story or not, he intended to make his point.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
The Marks was where you could get anything imaginable, sometimes items that were from outside the city. It gave me hope to see items from other places, and I wasn’t going to let Dad squash my dream. I turned to face him.
“Yes, Dad. You’ve told me a thousand times. Doesn’t matter that there is almost no crime anymore, don’t go to the Marks. Don’t go to the Marks.” I walked around the kitchen like a Frankenstein monster repeating the warning over and over. I caught a half smile on his face and knew that I had won him over.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“All right. All right. Can’t fault a father for wanting to protect his daughter.” He shook his coffee cup at me and a drop fell out, almost landing on his tablet. “Just because we can track any criminal doesn’t mean crime has disappeared. It means people have gotten better at hiding it.
And those people are the ones you meet at the Marks.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“Enough sermons, Dad. I hear what you are saying.” Doesn’t mean that I agree. “I have to go. See you for supper?” I bent down to kiss him on the forehead.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“You bet — crime docket is slow today, just like every day. Are you cooking tonight?”
he questioned with a brightness in his eyes. My Dad can’t boil water without burning it, so I cooked all the meals in the house. Not because I’m great cook, but my meals won’t burn the house down.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“I’ll give it a go, maybe a six-course meal?” I teased.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“Make it five. I’m trying to lose some weight.” He patted his stomach.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
I laughed and headed out the door. I jumped down the stairs three at a time and felt the sunshine on my face. The morning was quiet but a security drone flew overhead, its red light scanning the ground below. I tried to sidestep it, thinking it was one my Dad had sent after me to spy on me. As soon as I tried to avoid it, it must have picked up my vibrations (since no one else was out walking) and the beam inched towards me.
I stopped, knowing there was no way to outrun it. Better to let it take its reading and then be on my way. I felt the beam cover the back of my head. I closed my eyes, not because it could hurt me, but I preferred that when I opened my eyes again it would be gone. Seconds later, I looked straight ahead and it had already crossed the street, looking for another person’s presence to record. I didn’t know why they bothered; there were so many security cameras (one on every corner, as the city ads would sing) that they seemed redundant. I headed in the direction of school in case my Dad was watching. I didn’t look back, not wanting to appear guilty.
Once I was out of sight, I changed direction towards the Marks. I looked up every couple of minutes to make sure no more drones flew overhead. It wasn’t like they were tracking me specifically, just thinking of me as a bar code at a grocery store. Recording everything that went through so later they could do a data dump and try to make sense of all the information. I preferred to stay hidden.
The Marks were about a twenty-minute walk to the north. Not the best side of the city, but with virtually no crime, I never understood my father’s concern. Places like the Marks have always existed. A place of barter and exchange. One man’s garbage is another woman’s treasure.
Or something like that. There were rows and rows of stalls, from food to metals to precious stones. The vendors never seemed to stay in the same spot for too long, and the place was a maze of many back alleys and levels. It was always hard to find the ones you wanted, but you got the feeling that the vendors preferred the shuffling around. The most popular ones never stayed hidden for very long.
As I turned the corner, the smell got my attention first. The Marks were in a warehouse district. Hardly anyone lived in the area, otherwise they might be driven insane by the aromas of fresh foods wafting through the air. The Marks had one rule: no credits, only paper money. This was difficult since the rest of the city just scanned the bar code on your wrist and your account was billed. Because some items were a bit on the illegal side (okay, a lot on the illegal side), no one wanted to have their business transactions recorded. Avoiding paying taxes also drove customers here.
The aisles were narrow and many people were bartering with the merchants, creating an obstacle course to duck around. I was not watching where I was going and almost stepped on her.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lola
“Bark!” A metallic, high-pitched whine came from the ground. I stepped back and looked down. “Bark!” the cry came a little louder. I reached down to scoop up the small mechanical dog. Its tail was bent and there were several spots of rust on its hindquarters. Its tongue whipped out as if trying to lick me and it made a contented sound. I patted it on the head, although I doubted it was programmed to enjoy a human’s touch.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“Hey that’s my dog, put her down!” a boy yelled over the noise of the crowd. I looked up and saw a tall guy about my age with blond hair walking towards me. He walked confidently, like someone who knew the Marks.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“Sorry, she came up to me. She looks like an old model — isn’t she illegal?” I asked, handing the little dog over to him. Usually only the police could own and operate drones, although they often looked the other way if the drone wasn’t a danger to the public. The mechanical dog scurried along his shoulder and planted her two front legs, looking expectantly at her owner.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“Yah, well, that about describes half of the things you buy here. You know, you shouldn’t pick up things that don’t belong to you.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“Well, she came up to me. Maybe you should do a better job of taking care of her,” I shot back, being a bit rough. But if you walked the Marks, you needed to grow a thick skin. I recovered and tried to be friendly. “She’s awfully cute, where did you find her?”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
He perked up at my question. “I fixed her up from a scrap heap. Don’t know how much life she has in her. There are so few living pets around these days, thought I’d program my own.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
I looked at him more closely and saw a bunch of wires sticking out of his coat pocket. Typical techno geek. Probably here looking for some illegal electronics. Everyone’s got to have a hobby.
“Listen, I’m looking for a certain merchant. Seen a guy by name Lou? Sells unusual stuff, things from outside in the city.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“Sounds like a lot of the sellers here. Care to be a little more specific?” he asked while holding the wiggling dog.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“He promotes his goods as ‘from another planet,’ has a bunch of UFOs and spaceships hanging from his roof. Yells from an electronic megaphone.” I could tell from his eyes that he knew whom I was describing.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“That wacko — sure, everyone knows Lou. I do my best to avoid him. He’s a fraud, and most of his items are fakes. You don’t believe that his goods are from another world?”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
The cynic in me didn’t believe but the optimist hoped to see items made outside of the city.
That’s why I liked Lou’s stall — it gave me hope.
“Not really, but it’s a lot of fun to go through his stuff. Can you take me to him?” I asked.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
He reached down and depressed a button on his dog. She immediately perked up and disappeared into the crowd.
“Lola can find anyone. Just follow her nose. I’m Austin.” He offered his hand.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“I’m Pene.” I shook his hand. His skin was tough and calloused; he must do a lot of work with his hands. “Where do you go to school?” I sidestepped a couple of people yelling at a vendor.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“Armbrae — out on the north end. School’s small but they have a great electronics class.
Spend some of my time in the lab.” He blushed. “I guess that makes me sound like a geek.” His dimples made him kind of cute.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“No, it just means you’ve found something that interests you. A lot of the guys at my school barely show up for class.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“Where do you go?” Austin asked.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“Vestbrooke — I headed out early so I can spend time here before first period.” Up ahead I could see Lola barking at someone.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“Your parents must be pretty open-minded to let you walk around the Marks by yourself.” I looked away, not wanting to explain my family dynamics. He wouldn’t understand.
“Hey, Lola found your vendor!” Austin pointed and I was glad for the change of conversation.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
As we approached, Lou turned towards us and smiled. He was a heavyset man with a black hair and a beard, slightly balding and always with a huge smile. I wasn’t sure if it was a smile for enticing customers or if he really liked people. I had a feeling it was a bit of both.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lou
“Pene! My favorite customer!” The liar — I’ve seen him say the same thing to other customers. “I see you brought a friend with you. Please come with me.” He grabbed my hand and gestured me into his stall. He pulled us around a stack of boxes to a table with outer-worldly artifacts and metal objects. He motioned to us to sit. “Several new items this week.” Lou reached into one of his boxes and pulled out a strange statue made of iron. It was a creature with multiple limbs and eyes. I ran my hand over its hands. “The man I bought it from says it depicts an alien life form he was captured by.” Lou leaned into me. “Apparently he barely escaped.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
Austin made a motion twirling with his finger at the side of his head. He obviously didn’t have any faith in Lou’s products.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“No,” I answered. “What else do you have?” Lou proceeded unperturbed. He was the ultimate salesman. He reached into a bag and pulled out an electronic box.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lou
“What’s that? I asked.
“This fell out of a spaceship. It has advanced technology.” He beamed, seemingly believing it wholeheartedly. “If you touch this button,” he clicked on a raised red object, “it will open the spaceship.” Unfortunately, there was no way to prove Lou’s claim. It didn’t interest me, so I waved my hand to pass.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
The truth was that I wasn’t sure what I was looking for. I wasn’t trying to find an object from an alien culture, despite what Lou sold. I wanted an object from outside of our city, recognition that there was more than where we lived.
As I scanned Lou’s stall, the sun reflected off glass in the corner. I walked over unobserved as Lou went to work trying to sell to Austin. Several colors shimmered on the wall as the glass acted like a prism. I picked the object up. It was about the size of my hand but looked like a section of a much larger object. It was concave, the glass honeycombed and mirroring a dozen of my faces.
“Where did you find this, Lou?” I held it out. He turned, since Austin had proved very unreceptive to his sales pitch.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lou
“A mountain climber from Logan’s Pike sold it to me. He found a few of them on a plateau. Most of the other pieces were shattered but this piece had sunk into a depression. Is it something you would like to buy?” he asked expectantly.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
When it comes to the Marks, you never want to look too interested. If you do, the buyer knows he’s got you hooked.
“I’ll think about it. What’s in these boxes?” I pointed to the far corner to divert my interest. Lou wasn’t fooled.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lou
“If you take it now, I can let you have for, let’s say twenty credits?” Only a fool or a desperate customer takes the first price offered at the Marks. Some vendors are even offended if you take their first offer; it is an art to bargain and try to read the other’s person price.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“Twenty credits? That thing’s not worth five,” Austin interceded on my behalf. He guessed my price exactly.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“What he said.” I gestured to Austin but looked at Lou.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lou
“I couldn’t part with it for less than fifteen. I paid the climber a fair price, you know.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
Lou’s smile was fake and we both knew it.
“Maybe seven. I don’t think I brought anymore,” I lied and then turned away. I’m not the best liar and I thought he could read my face. Lou, on the other hand, was so over the top in his response, I felt he deserved some award.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lou
“How can you do this to me, Pene? We have been friends for many years. Do friends steal from each other?” It was a rhetorical question. “Of course not. I’m beginning to think that our relationship has come to an end. Perhaps I should not try to look out for your special interests anymore?” The look he gave me as I turned back was priceless. His performance was almost worth the price.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Lou — final offer. Ten credits. Take it or I will never darken your door again. And that’s a promise!”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lou
“Sold!” he answered enthusiastically and rushed to wrap it up for me. Austin leaned closer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“If you ask me—” he started.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“But I didn’t,” I interrupted, knowing that no one shared my interest of items outside of town.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“Hey, no fair, let me finish,” he complained.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“So you can tell me how I wasted my money?” I snapped. “Now I have to hide this from father. He thinks that I should be helping improve the city, not trying to leave it.” I didn’t mean to take out my frustration with my Dad on Austin.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Austin
“You’re misunderstanding,” Austin replied, gathering up Lola in his arms. “I was trying to say that you should always go for the things that are important to you. Most girls find the 15<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
electronics I buy weird.” His phone rang and he turned away to talk. A jealous girlfriend? I asked Lou to wait a few minutes and intended to apologize to Austin for acting like a drama queen. But as I turned around, he had disappeared into the crowd. Me and my big mouth.
“Hey Lou, hurry up. I have to catch up with my friend.” I laid out my credits on the table and he handed me my purchase.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
“Come next week,” he urged as I dashed away. “I have some items coming in from the underground.” His voice melted into the noise of the Marks. I saw Austin disappear into the west end of the stalls and I tried to catch up with him. As I dodged a large woman arguing with a vendor, a head-splitting siren began to screech.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Drone
A rush of air gushed past me as a drone flew by. It was the shape of a small motorcycle propelled by jet engines. The heat it gave off was immense. Its robotic driver had head and arms, but the rest of its body merged with the machinery. As people scattered, it hovered above a food stall further down, blowing skewers onto the ground. The robotic head swirled left to right, scanning the crowd. Everyone froze, looking like students in a classroom; no one wanted to be picked by the drone. Behind me a stack of crates fell to the ground. I turned and saw a horrified look on Lou’s face as he attracted the drone’s attention.
“You!” The drone pointed directly at Lou. “You are charged with theft. Step forward to accept your sentence!” Lou backed away, shocked by the command.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lou
“You’re mistaken, I’m a simple shop owner. I have stolen from no one,” he answered, almost sobbing. The drone hovered closer to Lou while everyone else tried to blend into the surroundings to avoid detection. Lou’s eyes scanned the Marks, looking for some point of escape. He seemed to focus on the right side, which went around a nearby warehouse. The drone’s eyes followed his glance, almost daring him to run, knowing that escape was nearly impossible. But common sense was not one of Lou’s strong points — he decided to run. Being a large man, he wasn’t graceful or fast and the drone merely watched his escape. I looked around; all of the vendors and buyers watched like zombies. No one offering to help, all of us assuming that justice was being served. Or none us wanting to be recorded for questioning the law.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Lou turned a corner and slammed into another drone. This one was humanoid but a good foot taller and probably a hundred pounds heavier. The drone picked him up as if he was as light as a pillow. The motorcycle drone circled above the stalls, making its announcement.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Drone
“Your streets are safe again. Continue your business — know that no crime goes undetected. You are watched for the greater good.” Everyone watched the drone as it repeated its message several more times, its voice fading as it disappeared further into the Marks. The larger drone carried Lou unceremoniously, like a sack of flour. I watched as they passed me, Lou’s big eyes popping out of his head. As his line of vision crossed my position he begged me, “I’ve never stolen from anyone. This is all wrong! You said your father was a lawyer. Help me!” And just like that, Lou and the drone disappeared into the crowd. The Marks returned to an uneasy rumble of voices as people ventured back to their business.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
There’s no way I am mentioning any of this to Dad. If he knew I was here, I’d suffer my own punishment. Sorry Lou, you’re on your own.
I made it into school a full minute before the doors were sealed and locked. If you were late, there was no sneaking into school. And you were wasting your time trying to get a drone to open the door by telling your sob story for not being on time. When I was in junior high, one of the boys tried to climb in a second-story window. He made it to class but not without a drone replaying the entire ‘break-in’ to the laughter of the class.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
As I walked the halls, the school’s television monitors flashed the latest news on their screens. From meetings to dances to homework, we lived in the age of communication. It was pretty hard to claim you weren’t informed of upcoming events. The problem was, with so much information, from homework to online quizzes, school’s reach never seemed to end. The end of day bell merely transitioned your studies to new location.
As I entered the room, I met the gaze of Mr. Stewart, my history instructor. He was around my Dad’s age but seemed to have more seniority than any teacher at the school. His main feature was his piercing gaze. His eyes were a deep ocean blue and you felt as if they were dissecting you as he watched. I immediately him watching me as I walked in and quickly found a position in the middle of the class behind a taller student. His gaze immediately shifted to another pupil, like a hawk watching its prey.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Did you just feel a chill in the air?” I turned as I sat down, smiling at my best friend, Lacey. She was taller than me, with bright red hair. Some of the boys would mumble “Racey”
when she got onto a topic that she had a strong opinion about. Down deep, I think she liked her nickname.
“Try getting into the classroom without one of his icy stares,” I replied.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lacey
“Sometimes I think Mr. Stewart is a drone — at least he has the personality of one,”
Lacey teased. I fumbled in my backpack, trying to get out my tablet for class. Lacey spotted my purchase from Lou.
“Where did you get that?” she asked. Before I could answer, a look of realization crossed her face. “Oh, wait a minute — were you slumming it in the Marks this morning?”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Do I have to answer that?” I replied, red-faced.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lacey
“Well, you’ll need a better lying face than that. If your Dad asked the same question, you’d be toast.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“I wish I was as talented as you,” I answered as I covered the glass with a towel.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lacey
“Why are you so crazy to find something from outside the city? I mean, when you get older, you can always get a job that takes you out of here. That is, if you can survive living with us commoners,” she teased. She waved her hand like a queen addressing her subjects. I squirmed in my chair.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“It’s not like that,” I said defensively. “I just want to see more than this city. See the mountains, the ocean, see the stars away from the city lights. Travel where there isn’t a drone five feet behind me.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lacey
“Good luck with that. You know they’re here for our protection,” she mimicked, repeating one of the public service announcements that we heard over and over. The bell sounded, and we knew better than to continue our conversation in Mr. Stewart’s class. We had learned not to draw attention to ourselves — call it a mixture of fear and respect. Two video screens dropped down from the ceiling and Mr. Stewart stood up from his desk. He was pencil-thin and his voice was high-pitched.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“Settle down — get your tablets out. I want you to bring up your history assignments.” A collective groan went up from the class. No one thought we were going to be graded today. He seemed to sense our unease. “Relax, I’m not marking today but I will be monitoring your progress.” He walked around the room, flicking with his fingers as he passed each student. Each assignment moved from the student’s tablet into his own. He did a word count in each and then moved on. I dreaded when he passed my desk. He flicked his tablet from mine to his, waited and then did it a second time.
“Haven’t started your history project yet, Pene. Your deadline is next week.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lacey
Lacey tried to come to my defense. “She’s best under pressure — nothing like getting it done at the last moment.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“But that’s not going to work. I explained at the start of the term how important it was, with the length and research required, that you work on it every week. What is your excuse?” His cold eyes burrowed into my skull, making me even more uncomfortable as the rest of the class waited for my answer.<|im_end|>

The answer was actually quite simple. School bored me. To tears. I knew it, my Dad certainly knew it and probably half the class had already teased me about it. I couldn’t help myself, things just didn’t seem urgent until the last minute. And trust me, I’m great under pressure. Once I get rolling, I can accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. When others freeze, I can fly. I’m always able to think quickly to get myself out of a jam. This was one of those times.
“I’ve been waiting to interview my Dad. He’s cancelled a few times because of work but he’s promised me definitely this week,” I lied, keeping my face neutral to contain my emotions.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
Mr. Stewart looked suspicious but then nodded.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Then get it done, Pene. With your father a lawyer with the ministry, I’ll be expecting a first-rate project. I think I’ll let you present first in the class.” A faint smile crossed his face, like a cat that had just swallowed a bird and was going to enjoy every moment of eating it. I had the exact opposite feeling. Dad rarely talked about work (conflict of interest was his excuse) and it would be like pulling teeth to get any information out of him. I slumped in my chair as Lacey read my body language.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lacey
“Come on,” she whispered, “appeal to his ego. Tell him how interested you are in his job.
If you look at him with your big brown eyes, he won’t refuse.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Telling him I’ll fail the course would be a better approach,” I whispered back just as Mr.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
Stewart turned, silencing any further conversation.
“Open your tablets to page 355, new legislation on security. I want to review the setup of the ministry.” Tablets flashed as students scrolled to the correct page.
“Is it true that until the ministry was formed, crime was at the highest level in history?”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Cory
asked Cory, a scrawny guy who always asked questions that he knew the answer to.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“That’s correct. If you turn to page 358, you’ll see a photo from a typical street in the city.” We scrolled to look at the photo.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Alyvia
“There’s no security cameras. People could do anything and not get caught,” a girl named Alyvia commented. Mr. Stewart pulled out his digital wand and circled several buildings in the photo to illustrate her comment.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“Before the ministry was created, there were no cameras to protect society. Crimes went undetected, vandalism, theft, even murder went unpunished.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Cory
“Is that when drones were introduced?” Cory asked again, and several groans came from the class. We all knew that he already was well aware of the answer. Mr. Stewart sat on the edge of his desk, looking pleased to explain the security of the city. Again.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“Before you were born, we lived in a lawless city. Criminals could commit crimes undetected, and those that were caught took years to punish or never served time for their crime.
People felt unsafe as soon as they left their homes. In an effort to provide safety, security cameras were installed on every street corner, in every store. But we soon learned that they were not enough.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lacey
“Why? Is that when the drones were built?” asked Lacey, showing an unexpected interest in the topic. I gave her a glare while she made a face back at me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“Not quite. Because criminals knew where the cameras were, they could evade or wreck them to prevent being caught on recorders. Then the ministry placed secret cameras, putting them in places not obvious to the public. Unfortunately, camera locations were eventually discovered, and as people became aware of them, they were destroyed or avoided.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Cory
“When are we going to get to the drones?” a boy asked from the back to the class. Mr.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
Stewart raised his head slowly and looked at us, like a politician ready to discuss his main message.
“Drones were introduced by the ministry to watch over citizens. While the cameras were tethered to specific locations, drones could come and go at any location. Their benefits were immediate and the crime rate dropped dramatically. When crimes were committed, they were immediately recorded and the criminals jailed immediately.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Unknown
“Is it true that court cases used take years to complete?” a girl behind me asked.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“I’m sure Pene’s father could answer that.” Mr. Stewart looked at me and then continued.
“Yes, with the drone footage, justice is swift and final. Appeals are no longer required as the drone footage is irrefutable. We truly live in a golden age!” I thought that Mr. Stewart was going to start singing the national anthem after his impassioned speech. Silence greeted him instead of a rousing cheer. He looked around the room with his icy stare, driving his point home.
“Can anyone sum up in a few words the differences the drones have made in our lives?”
Mr. Stewart looked straight at Cory to begin.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Cory
“No crime,” he stated.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Alyvia
“No victims,” a girl yelled from the front. Mr. Stewart scanned the room, looking for more feedback.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Anderson
“No privacy,” I shot out and immediately regretted my outburst. Lacey gave me a look as if to say, ‘What is wrong with you?’<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“Would you like to clarify your statement, Miss Anderson?” His eyes looked as if they would bore through the back of my head. Oh well, I started this, I may as well see it through. I choose my words carefully.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Anderson
“The drones record all criminal activity but they also observe everyone’s actions, from eating to walking down the street. Sometimes even when they’re not there, I feel like something is watching me.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Cory
“Like in the washroom,” Cory added. Mr. Stewart gave a cold stare that immediately shut him up, and he slunk down in his chair. Mr. Stewart paced around the classroom.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“A little loss of privacy is a small price to pay for safety. Knowing you can walk the streets without fear, that no criminal can go unpunished.” Mr. Stewart walked down the aisle of seats while giving his sermon, looking into the eyes of each student. I remembered Lou’s eyes as he was accused and wondered if our society was as safe as my teacher described.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lacey
“What triggered the drone act of 2025?” Lacey asked. I was more than happy for the change in focus. Fighting Mr. Stewart was a battle I didn`t want. He walked back to his desk.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“A group of anarchists took over the generating plant on the west side of the city. Their demands for a ransom were not met. They triggered an explosion that created a monumental earthquake, making buildings collapse and creating a blackout throughout the city for over three weeks. Instead of causing chaos, this incident galvanized the government to form the Ministry.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
The drone officers were released immediately, patrolling all streets and helping clean the rubble from the earthquake. Their friendly presence inspired thousands.” I thought about the police drones that took Lou away; they seemed neither friendly nor inspiring. Cold and heartless were better descriptors.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Unknown
“Is that why they say there are underground buildings and tunnels under the city?” A girl in the front row asked. Mr. Stewart fixed her with a glance that said ‘What a stupid question’.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“Of course not. Almost all of the old buildings were torn down. The few remaining buildings underground were unsafe and remain condemned in the east side of the city. Whenever you go to the town hall by the Justice Building, you can see the monument that commemorates the drones and the years of peace they have created.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
A knock on the window diverted my attention. A bee drone was hovering outside, its eyes scanning the class and then stopping when it saw me. At least that’s what it looked like; drones aren’t made to find people, only to record what they see. I could almost see some type of intelligence in its eyes, as if was tracking me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“Hope we aren’t interrupting your daydreams, Pene?” Mr. Stewart asked while the class laughed at my distraction. I turned to him to respond but realized any excuse was worthless. I did the only thing I could to salvage the moment.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Sorry, Mr. Stewart.” He dismissed me with his right hand and turned to the front of class.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Stewart
“Can I get everyone to turn to page 385, to the aftermath of the earthquake and the new government?” Fingers tapped on screens as we searched for the content.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
I turned my head to the window but the drone had gone. Typical — when you don’t want them, you can’t get them out of your sight. And when you want them, they’re gone.
I wished I could be gone too.
Snow fluttered through the air, swirling in a circle as it slowly sank to the ground. Flakes touched the castle turret, which was whiter from the snow than gray from the rock foundation. A boy with a sled lay frozen to the ground, his sightless eyes looking forward into space beyond his sphere. I shook the snow globe again, marvelling at the detail; a silly gift from my mother before her accident.
I sat down in a comfortable armchair by my father’s desk, surveying the shelves of books in his office. Why would you read from these bulky things when you had so much information on your tablet? I pulled one from the wall. It was titled, Frontier Justice, with a hangman and noose on the cover. A body dangled from the rope while a crowd watched with silent interest.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lord
“See something you like?” I turned and looked into a drone eye. Its flashing red light swallowed me in its viewer. I was too shocked to answer, so my Dad spoke, entering from the doorway.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“You remember Lord don’t you, honey?” he asked. “Last time you saw him you were probably in grade three.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Of—of course,” I stammered. “It’s good to see you again, sir.” Lord oversaw all Commented [AT1]: So if he’s a Lord, is this the UK? I hadn’t thought about that, I just wanted his title to convey of the lawyers on the government staff, including my Dad. Because safety was all-important in his importance. Maybe something else?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Commented [AT2]: Well, yeah, if it’s not meant to be Britain and it’s not a fantasy, “Lord” is a weird designation.
the city, he seemed to have more power than the mayor or other city officials. He was tall and Judge, Superintendent, Governor, Commandant (ok, some of those don’t fit), anything officious. Mind you, you could get thin, almost like a scarecrow, with cropped gray, thinning hair. His eye was one of the early away with Lord, I’m just being picky. ;><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lord
drone transplants; today replacements were barely noticeable. His presence unnerved me, and although his good eye turned to Dad, his drone eye studied me.
“It’s wonderful to see children of our lawyers visiting their parents at work. Makes me think we’re training the next generation for our legal system.” Lord slapped Dad too hard on the shoulder and a pen came tumbling out his hand. As Dad stooped down to pick it up, Lord stared at me with a pleasant smile, but his drone eye seemed to dissect my innermost thoughts. I shuddered uncontrollably.
“So what do I owe the pleasure of your visit, Pene?” My Dad half smiled and then reconsidered. “You didn’t get into any trouble today?”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“No, Dad,” I answered, “I have a school project on the evolution of the legal system and my teacher kind of wanted some information straight from the source.” Before he could answer, Lord intervened.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lord
“Well, you’ve come to the right place, young lady. Since the great earthquake, the legal system has evolved into a flawless, efficient machine. Do you know that your Dad has a 99%
prosecution rate?”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“He’s mentioned once or a hundred times,” I replied, a smile cracking my face. Lord sat down on the couch in the corner, folding his long, thin legs.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lord
“You live in exciting times. Do you realize that we have thousands of cameras strategically placed throughout the city at most major intersections and venues? Coupled with satellite footage, no crime goes undetected. The crime rate is single digits, and justice is swift.”
Lord looked satisfied with his lesson.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“Imagine before you’re born,” my Dad added. “Trials could take years, and many times criminals went free. I received footage from a crime today. Trial will be tomorrow and the sentencing the day after. Our justice system is fair and swift.” A question bubbled up from my thoughts. I hesitated, since it was something I would usually ask Dad when we were alone.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Do many crimes go undetected? I mean, we can’t have cameras everywhere.” My question seemed to energize Lord, who jumped up from the couch like a man half his age to respond.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lord
“Excellent question, my dear. I can see you following in your father’s footsteps.” He beamed. His smile was sharp, though, like a politician’s, and I doubted his sincerity. “One of my jobs has been to lobby our government for more drones, more cameras to watch over and protect our society. Their costs are expensive but the benefits of a safe society can’t be measured in dollars and cents. The Justice Committee has even explored ‘other avenues’ of observation.” His eyes shone as if we were discussing a favorite hobby.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Such as…?” I leaned in, hoping for a hint in his cryptic description.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“Pene!” my Dad interrupted, embarrassed at my forwardness.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lord
Lord laughed. “Ah, the youth of today, always so inquisitive.” He stepped up to leave. “I can’t give all our secrets away — we don’t want the criminals to learn how to evade them.” He leaned forward to tap me on the shoulder. I’m sure he thought it was a fatherly gesture but it just felt creepy to me. I involuntarily shivered. His grin was piecing and his drone eye scanned me once more as he exited.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Evan
“Evan, don’t forget to review the latest case before you go home.” He waved and disappeared into the hall. My Dad fixed me with a reproachful stare.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“You know that he is one of the most powerful men in the city,” he said as he sat down at his desk. I slumped into the couch across from him.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“I’m sorry. He scares me with his drone eye. It throws me off.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“Well, just remember he protects people like you and me. Just because his eye is a machine, it doesn’t make him any less human. Come on, they must teach you something in 28
school about treating people equally?” I made a face at him. He began to sweep his fingers over the computer tablet and then stopped. “How come you came to see me at work? You haven’t done that in years. Do you need money?” I could see he was jokingly trying to get under my skin.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“No, Dad. Can’t your lovely daughter come see you at work?” I batted my eyelashes to add to the exaggeration. My Dad simply stared at me, waiting for me to come clean. “Okay.” I slouched further into the couch. “I procrastinated and have a history project due on the evolution of justice. My teacher requested,” I lied, “that I interview you to get details on how the justice system has changed over the years. I know how tired you get at home so I thought I’d catch you at work.” I raised my eyebrows in the insane hope that I was making my eyes bigger and my face cuter. It had the desired effect.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“When’s it due?” he asked.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pene
“Next week, and he wants about 5,000 words.” Now it was my father’s turn to raise his eyebrows.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“Well, you have some work ahead of you. Pull out your recorder and get your list of questions out. I just need five minutes to scrub through this footage.” He pointed at his tablet.
“And then we can get started.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Unknown
Someone knocked on the door.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dad
“Come in,” my Dad commanded. I felt wary that Lord had returned, as if his drone eye wanted to examine me further. Instead, a younger man came in with a stack of papers.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Clerk
“Sorry to interrupt,” the clerk said to Dad. “I need you to sign off on the footage from the last case.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Commented [AT3]: He would know it’s standard
procedure if he does it every day.<|im_end|>
