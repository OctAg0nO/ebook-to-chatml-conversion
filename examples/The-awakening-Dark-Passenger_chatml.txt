﻿Farage was standing in front of Primrose Cottage. He remembered the first time he laid eyes on it. It had been the beginning of autumn, and the village of Gateway Hill had just started to transform itself into a picture-perfect orange-and-yellow garden. Right in the middle was the beautiful, three-little-pigs-worthy, cute stone cottage with a thatched roof.
The garden beds were packed tight with plants. At first he had been puzzled by the informal crowding of the large variety of flowers all around the garden, but then he realised that the mix of perennial flowers with foliage plants was what had turned that cottage into the village’s prettiest dwelling.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Farage
Except this time he was not getting the usual tingling of pleasure he got every time he opened that gate. Primrose’s sweet pink stone path to the wooden door, once so picturesque, was slowly turning into the path to the executioner.
He stood in front of the door, his heart racing and sweat starting to drip along his temples. For the first time, he regretted his sense of style. He had always been a big fan of three-piece pinstripe or chalk-stripe suits and always wore a fedora hat. This time his hat and his suit were burning him, and he couldn’t stop sweating. He was about to turn back when the door opened.
Oh, for heaven’s sake, he thought while shrugging his shoulders.
He already had his back to the door and was not quite sure how to explain his presence, but he had been caught trying to leave and decided that he had no other choice but to turn around. And so he did, wearing his best smile.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Standing at the door was a skinny gentleman in a brown suit; Farage only knew him as Bob. Bob was pale, with dark circles under his eyes. Farage had always wondered what his function was in the house.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Bob
With his slow voice, Bob asked, “Can I help you?”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Farage
“I would like to see Her Highness,” said Farage.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Bob
Without a word, Bob slowly opened the door wide, then stepped back and waited.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Farage
Farage reluctantly stepped inside the cottage. He slowly walked through the narrow beige corridor with the royal’s shih-tzu showing him the way.
When he walked into the small living room, he took a moment to look around him. On the left wall was an old red-brick fireplace with a large rustic oak beam above it, and above that were three handcrafted blue-and-white wall plates. An elegant seventeenth-century bureau was at the right of the fireplace. On the floor was a beautiful eighteenth-century red Persian rug, and on the left of the room was a stunning handmade marquetry dining table made of burr-walnut, with matching chairs. The table was set for tea with a Victoria sponge cake, a few watercress sandwiches and a fine china tea set, which almost matched the wall plates.
The royal was sitting in a mid-nineteenth-century upholstered armchair of large proportions in Carolean style. It had American walnut veneer over a beech-wood frame.
Farage’s heart always raced when he laid eyes on the royal, with her smooth olive skin, her long dark hair, her penetrating dark eyes, her high cheeks and her plumped and pouty mouth.
She has a face to launch a thousand ships, he thought.
He was also extremely attracted to her oversized bosom, her wide hips and her long legs, which she loved to cross and uncross in front of her. That day, she was wearing a high-necked, long-sleeved and backless see-through black dress with a short train. He thought she looked spectacular. He wouldn’t have expected a woman of her size to be wearing such a revealing outfit, but her confidence and the unapologetic way she was flaunting her generous curves was what made her the head-turner she was.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Royal
She approached him very slowly, wearing a small smile on her face. She was barefoot. When she reached him, she gently touched his right shoulder and walked around him, still touching him. She couldn’t help the little smirk of contentment when she noticed his breathing accelerating. She loved how easily people became aroused around her. She eventually walked around him and came back full-circle, facing him.
“Why are you scared of me today? What is wrong, my dear Farage?” she said while playing with the black lace around her right wrist.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Farage
“Your Highness,” he said in a trembling voice, “the vicar has refused your offer. He is demanding that we leave the village immediately, or he will be forced to call the authorities.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Royal
She took a big breath, walked a few steps backwards and said, “Very well, show him how serious we are. Dispose of the boy.”
She was no longer smiling. Even her gait was no longer seductively swaying; it was straight and firm like a soldier’s. She turned back and sat on her antique armchair, both her arms resting on the chair’s arms.
“Darling, can you come in here?” she yelled without taking her eyes off Farage.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Unknown
A teenage boy, skinny, short and Middle Eastern, appeared from the other end of the cottage, his short and wavy hair shining and his dark eyes staring at Farage arrogantly.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Royal
“Go and get a poisonous fly for our friend Farage. He is in desperate need of one.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Unknown
Without uttering a word, the boy walked out of the living room and started climbing the stairs opposite.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Farage
“I will take care of it personally,” said Farage.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Royal
“No, you won’t. Find a human who has not yet proven their loyalty to us to our satisfaction,” said the royal while getting up from her chair. She then slowly approached him and said, “After the deed is done, reward the human and inform our dear vicar that unless the entire village is handed to us, you will personally organise the pied pipers to land on their doorsteps. Do I make myself clear?”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Farage nodded and suddenly heard footsteps. He turned around and saw the teenager standing behind him.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Unknown
“Here you go,” said the adolescent.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
He extended his arm and opened his palm. Farage noticed a small tattoo on his right wrist. It was round, with outlines of the silhouette of what seemed to be a face. It was the royal family’s insignia. The only people allowed to wear it were their most trusted and loyal local servants. Farage realised that he was facing one of them.
The royal family had been enslaving humans for centuries, and rumour had it that the descendants of those humans were immediately born into slavery. Since his arrival on Earth, he had yet to meet one of high rank, until this day.
The slaves were ranked from the lower caste to the higher caste. The lower-caste slaves were those with no value other than for use in scientific experiments or human behaviour studies. They were just given the bare minimum to survive, because their life expectancy was so short.
The caste just above the lower caste was considered necessary for manual labour and nothing more. They, too, were given the bare minimum but were allowed to live in their own homes, unlike the lower caste, who were kept in confinement.
The lower-middle caste were used for their intellectual prowess, and they were given better accommodations than the lower castes, and also bonuses during religious holidays.
The higher-middle caste were also used for their intellectual prowess, but due to their intellect being far superior to any other caste’s, they were kept in relative luxury and given a chance to join the higher-caste rank.
The last caste was the higher caste. They were slaves only on paper. They had willingly offered themselves to the royal family, and no one was above them, besides the aliens themselves. They were extremely wealthy and had control over all other slaves and took their orders directly from the royal family and no one else.
Farage grabbed the transparent box holding three flies and brought it to eye level. They were miniature robot flies infused with poison. Their technicians had designed them especially for use on humans.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Royal
He bowed to the royal, who nodded, signifying the end of the meeting, and left. The royal then turned to the adolescent, still sitting on her chair with her arms resting comfortably on the chair arms, and said, “Watch his chosen one closely. If they refuse to execute the boy, or if anything goes wrong, I will expect you to finish the mission for them.”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Adolescent
The boy nodded affirmatively, then left the room, following the same route Farage had taken.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Farage
The next day, Farage was back in J. C. Maxwell Academy, the boarding school where he had been working for years. He was looking around the dining room. He had spotted Nigel Weatherford, son of Gateway Hill’s vicar, Weatherford. He turned to a skinny, pale blonde woman with brown eyes and wearing an animal-print dress. He asked her, “Are you ready?”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Dujardin
She nodded yes, then opened the palm of her hand. In it was the transparent box. She opened the box and an already moving robotic fly flew away. The poisonous fly had been the preferred method of killing for the group in order to avoid the attention of the police and shed doubt on the victim’s family’s claim that their loved one had been murdered.
Despite her repugnance at killing a child, Dujardin was determined to carry out her mission. She had already given up too much; an additional dead child wouldn’t change much. It went without a hitch. After the food stations had been opened and the students had made their choice, they sat down. As soon as they sat down, they noticed a fly circling around the youngest students’ table. A few of them tried to chase it away by waving their hands, and it seemed to have disappeared. A few minutes later, the fly reappeared, landed on the young Weatherford, then flew out a nearby window.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Weatherford had just started to eat his salad when he turned red and grabbed his throat, struggling to breathe. The boy next to him grabbed him just as he was falling from the table bench. Other students got up and tried to help, carrying him and laying him on the floor while the other students ran to get help from the teachers. It was unnecessary. They had watched the scene and were quick to respond.
Weatherford was still clinging to his friend’s hand, his eyes filled with fear. He eventually pulled his other hand up and grabbed his friend’s shirt. Then he fell on the floor while his friend tried to get hold of him. As soon as he hit the ground, he lost consciousness.
Other staff members took the students away, and they all watched the paramedics come in and examine Weatherford. Dujardin was still supervising the hit; she watched a paramedic leaning over Weatherford. He raised his head, looked at the school staff facing him and shook it negatively. Weatherford’s art teacher screamed and slowly slipped down all the way to the floor and covered her mouth with her hands. Others came down to her level and tried to help her up, but she pushed them away. The paramedics transported the little boy’s corpse to the ambulance.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Young boy
Standing at the back of the room, watching silently, was a young boy. His dark eyes met with Dujardin’s brown eyes. She raised her head in defiance and he smiled. She is officially one of us now, he thought.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Vicar and the village mayor
The next day, the vicar, with the assistance of the village mayor, allowed the group to take full control of Gateway Hill.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Diana Amara Bouba Korsning
As difficult as it was for us to leave Yanara, we were pretty excited to be sent to Surrey. We had heard from our family members how beautiful Surrey Hills was, but we were not prepared for what we saw. The region was stunning. The land and the trees were still green when we arrived in September, but we could already see some patches of orange and yellow announcing autumn’s arrival.
Most Yan children graduated from school at the age of sixteen and started military service for two years. The members of the Ten, however, were sent to Masani boarding schools and only attended military service during the summer, so their military service was extended. This required them to start FIST, our fighting skills training, at the age of fourteen for boys and ten for girls, which was the case for my sister, Amelia, and me. I, Diana Amara Bouba Korsning, was from the sovereign duchy of Yanar, and a member of the Ten, Yanar’s ruling families.
The sovereign duchy of Yanar was born a thousand years ago. It was created by Yans from all over the world who had to flee their countries after being persecuted for having supernatural powers. The Yans acquired their powers thanks to an event that happened in a parallel dimension to Earth. Unbeknown to human beings, a world called Hendu, which was technologically much more advanced than Earth, had become aware of its existence.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
The Hendus, in an attempt to cross over to Earth and gain more information about humans, tried to create a breach between their world and Earth that would allow them to cross over. The result was not what they had hoped for. Instead of allowing them to cross over, the experiment created an explosion so strong that it destroyed one of their own neighbouring planets.
The energy deriving from the destroyed planet broke a tiny part of the veil separating Earth from Hendu and infected ten per cent of Earth’s population. The humans infected by the energy deriving from the exploding planet in the parallel universe developed supernatural powers and decided to call themselves Yans.
The tears in the veil separating the two universes appeared in a few parts of the world at the same time. The locals only reported seeing a bright light that came over them, and nothing else. It wasn’t until after they started procreating that they realised that their children were different from other children. They were taller, stronger, smarter and even more beautiful than the others; they stood apart from everyone around them, even their own parents. After some time, they realised that after the girls began their menstruation, they started to develop supernatural abilities.
As time went on, the locals started to fear these extraordinary children more and more, so much so that the families whose dependants were showing any sign of Nephilim-like qualities were relocated to the edge of each village.
Eventually, tension started to erupt between the gifted and the non-gifted, with some non-Yan inhabitants believing that the Yans’ abilities were a gift from the gods and that the villages should be run by them and not the actual lords of the land.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Yans
Fearing for their standing in the community, some lords tried to exterminate the Yans and burn their homes, while in other places Yans were simply chased out of their homes with torches and pitchforks. In some places, the Yans and their families managed to flee, but in others, the mobs were met with deadly force and killed. In retaliation for the attempts on their lives, the Yans destroyed the lords’ homes and fields, then left and built their own society.
For fear of being attacked and chased on their way to their new land, they lived as nomads until they could find a place to call their own. They would stop their wandering just long enough to replenish their provisions and sell their skills. Slowly but surely, they started to hear of others like them, searching for a land of their own. They gathered together whenever they could and left signs for others to follow.
They eventually settled on a series of islands in the Pacific Ocean and in time were joined by other Yans. It took us Yans over a hundred years to all be together, but we eventually found our way to our promised land.
At first Yanar was only inhabited by Yans. Years and years of silence and no contact had made the memory of enhanced people nothing but a legend, and people forgot all about their existence until eventually non-gifted individuals started coming to the islands, explorers sent by kings and queens in search of riches and gold for their sovereign. Not wanting to be invaded by non-gifted individuals, the Yans destroyed the explorers’ boats, and the explorers were given a choice: remain in Yanar forever with no contact with the outside world, or death. They chose to remain and protect the secret of Yanar’s inhabitants.
Eventually, they adapted and started families with the Yans. However, after a while, it was discovered that in some families, although one of the parents was Yan, the children were born with no special abilities at all. They could be Masani, the name given to non-gifted individuals. However, these children would still carry the blue genes, the genes from which Yan powers came, and therefore could produce a Yan child with abilities.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Being cut off from the world allowed the Yans to forge a society adapted to their gifts, and unlike the rest of the world, nothing happened to hinder their scientific progress, which allowed them to become very advanced. They advanced so quickly, and their numbers grew so rapidly, that they decided to colonise a large part of the Arctic and named it Yanara, which was my hometown.
The Yan power holders were divided into six groups: water, air, rock, fire, energy and omni. The Yan culture was based on two principles: strength and intellect. The long journey that the Yans had had to make in order to find a home and then later establish their society made them realise that humans were not far from animals when they felt threatened, and threatened was what they felt every time a group of travelling Yans came close to their villages or cities. To avoid being slaughtered and having their children become what their enemies were, the Yans established a code of conduct. No matter where they were or how many enemies they were facing, those rules needed to be lived by.
Although very few boys were born with powers, the Yan males could still receive powers if they were transferred to them by a blood relative. That action was called genetic transfer and was only allowed in cases of extreme necessity, like a war, because genetic transfers could be lethal to the receiver. That power was to be retransferred to a female relative after the war to avoid the power being wasted.
Unlike the girls, the Yan males could not transfer their power over to their descendants, because powers were transferred from mother to child. All powers were pretty common, except for one: fire. The fire power was not only extremely rare but also did not discriminate. When the gene appeared, it could do so in a boy or a girl. It was also considered a sign of danger, because the fire power only revealed itself in cases of great peril for the Yans.
The First World War brought more Masanis to the shores of Yanar than ever before. Generally, it would have been inhabitants of neighbouring islands seeking a better life, or just adventurers, but this time the Yans had soldiers at their doors. The general council knew that with their numbers growing, they couldn’t allow that many aliens to remain with them, and killing all of them was out of the question, so a decision was reached: they would return the captured soldiers to their homeland, and an invisible wall would be built around all Yanar territories to stop all non-Yans from entering.
Just as they finished building Yanara, the city in the Arctic, the council, knowing how evil and greedy Masani governments could be, prepared for war and had to accelerate the move to the Arctic. As it turned out, the war council was right. As soon as the soldiers returned to their homeland, it did not take long for their governments to send boats and planes to Yanar, and the Yans were ready for them.
What happened next was unexpected for both sides. The fight had barely started when the Yans realised how easily they could win over the Masanis. Much to their chagrin, the Masanis were quickly defeated. The Yans had prepared themselves for a possible David versus Goliath scenario, but it was baby David versus Goliath. The Masanis were hundreds of years behind the Yans in technology, not to mention their lack of any supernatural attributes. The council returned the soldiers to their governments and destroyed their planes and boats with a clear warning: come back again, and face the total annihilation of your countries and your inhabitants.
From that moment on, the Masani governments kept trying to get in contact with the Yans. Eventually, the general council realised that the lack of contact with the Masani world was a weakness on the Yans’ part, and they agreed to have diplomatic relations with them, which were delayed by the Second World War.
The horrors that resulted from World War Two convinced the war council that the Masanis were nothing but savages unworthy of their friendship, and the military budget and research for better weapons was tripled in preparation for a war with the Masanis, if it ever came to that. The general council and the council of interior affairs disagreed, so a compromise was reached.
After the war, embassies were opened in many countries, and a small, regulated number of immigrants were allowed to move to Yanar and live among the Yans under strict conditions decided by the council of interior affairs. In return, the same would be allowed for Yan families in all countries where a Yan embassy was located. A few families were sent to the Masani world in order to watch their progression more closely and report on their way of life and culture from a ground-level perspective. The settlers were forbidden from using their supernatural abilities in the Masani world. It was also forbidden to share technology with them.
The news filled many Yans with joy; the desire to go and see their ancestral lands was a call they had wanted to respond to for centuries, and now the opportunity was presenting itself.
The migration was carefully planned to respect the agreements made with the Masani governments, which was fairly easy because the Masanis were so curious about the Yan world, and so hopeful to benefit from their friendship with the Yan government, that the agreements signed were quite relaxed.
Arriving in the Masani world felt like arriving in the Stone Age to the Yans, but it was otherwise agreeable. It went so well that before the Yan general council realised it, they had representatives all over the world. With the Yan culture being very different from other cultures, the immigrants had to open their own schools and live in the same neighbourhoods as each other to preserve their culture and teach the new generation about the Yan way of life, as well as return to Yanar for a visit as much as possible.
The news of the superhumans’ existence spread everywhere. Hordes of people surrounded Yan embassies to get a glimpse of the Yans and tried to get a visa to visit Yanar, but with no visas allowed, the fad passed. It was also impossible to know who was a Yan or not without being told, although many movies were made about Yans.
In Yanar, graduation year was called the year of ascension. This meant that any child holding a graduation certificate was ready for an adult life. After my graduation ceremony, my mother called me into her office. I knew that it was an important meeting, because she looked very serious.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Weatherford
She explained to me that they had uncovered some irregular disturbance in some parts of the world.
“What kind of disturbance?” I asked.
She said that it was the kind of disturbance that could breach the veil separating us from the parallel world.
That was worrying. Yanar was already at war with an alien race who were trying to invade Earth.
My father was leading our space forces, and he had the alien fleet cornered just past Uranus, but I was worried that we may not have had much army left on the ground for a two-front war.
“If I didn’t know better, I would think that the Masanis have found a way to cross to the other side,” she said. “But I do know better, and I know for a fact that they do not possess such technology, let alone the necessary powers to do so,” she added.
All this time it was as if she was talking to herself, staring at her desk. She finally raised her head, her blue eyes looking straight at me, and said, “That is where you come in. Although you are only fifteen, you have managed to graduate and are now officially ascended, and I have had very good reports on your performances in FIST.”
My mother wasn’t one to give her children compliments, so I was pretty surprised and happy. I sat more comfortably on my chair and stared back at her with a proud look on my face and a cheeky grin.
She said, “I’m going to send you to the UK. The strongest reading has been detected in Surrey. I need you to investigate the anomalies, find out what or who is causing them and report to me. Do not engage with anyone. Your job is to report, not to stop the perpetuators.”
“Very well, Mother,” I said.
“You will be going with Amelia. She hasn’t reached the age of ascension yet, but with your brothers at the front and me busy with the general council, I’d prefer her to be with you. Make sure she is safe, and keep up with her training.”
“Yes, Mother,” I answered.
“You will also be going with the Wu twins and a few other Yans. Their parents have volunteered their services in case of trouble. They know nothing about the mission, and I’d prefer that they remain in the dark. The only person you will clue in is Pam. Do you understand?”
I nodded yes, but inside I was thinking, Hell no. I’ll clue Alex in. Pam will do it herself, anyway, and if any of the other Yans happen to be my friends, I’ll clue them in too. Sorry, Mother.
“You can go now, child. It’s almost time to chat with your father,” she said.
The meeting was over. Yan parents were not known for their affectionate ways towards their children. The Yans believed that if parents showed too much affection towards their children, it would make the children weak, and therefore lower-quality soldiers.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Couples, however, were very affectionate towards each other, to the point of embarrassment for children sometimes. Public displays of affection towards a partner were very common in Yanar.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Weatherford
But now here I was, about to embark on a secret mission, and my mother was showing that she cared about my wellbeing by making sure that I would not be alone in Surrey.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
I eventually found out that Amelia and I were being sent to a boarding school called J. C. Maxwell Academy. It used to be a Catholic boarding school but had been donated to Surrey County Council, and it was the best school in the vicinity of the anomaly recorded by the Yan science council.
The reason given to the UK government for choosing J. C. Maxwell as the school to send me, the future leader of Yanar, to was that J.C. was a very popular school among our people. The UK government was concerned by the lack of security around Amelia and me at J.C., but they were told by the council that as long as no one knew that we were members of the Ten, there was nothing to fear.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Weatherford
It wasn’t difficult to convince the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Although J.C. had become a non-religious school, they had maintained the high level of standards implemented by the previous owners.
It did not take long for us to get to Gateway Hill, the village adjacent to the school. The village had actually been built to provide accommodation for the workers and their families during the construction of the school. Then later it was used for the school staff and their families.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
As time went by, more and more people moved to Gateway Hill, and by the time the school was donated to Surrey County Council, the village had become a town on its own and was no longer associated with the Catholic church or even considered an extension of the school grounds.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Weatherford
Gateway Hill was even more picturesque than I had thought. It was situated between Bowlhead Green and Milford. I had heard that since changing its name from Ceaster to Gateway Hill, the village had been attracting a large number of visitors, which was not unlike what I was witnessing.
There seemed to be a lot of people visiting. If I hadn’t known better, I would I have thought that there was a conference of some sort happening. When we stopped and asked around, we were told that it was often that way in autumn, when they had all kinds of attractions organised by the town hall to occupy visitors.
We were also told that the village had been renovated to make it look like you had stepped back in time. They were right. Its reputation for its honey-coloured seventeenth-century-lookalike stone cottages with steeply pitched roofs was not exaggerated. It was stunning.
Gateway Hill had been built around Thursley Lake, which meant that the lake cut through the middle of the village. Each side had a similar concentration and scale of development.
Despite the beauty around me, I couldn’t help but feel a pinch in my heart. The sea of tourists had just reminded me of my beloved Yanara and its incessant crowds, but as soon as we left Gateway Hill, the most spectacular and terrifying view we had seen so far was standing in front of us: J. C. Maxwell Academy, more commonly called J.C..
It was beautiful, surrounded by dense woodland that looked like an enchanted forest without the fairies. Sometimes I think that if someone had listened very carefully, they would have sworn they had heard the wind singing as it was passing through, following us all the way to the school.
The whole building was built on a hill, almost like it was dug in. The entrance was in the main court, which was built in the style of a Spanish monastery. After crossing the main court, we ended up in front of a three-storey building.
The ground floor was made of arches that let us see into the classrooms. The first floor was also made up of classrooms, and the second floor was where the staff could rest and have their tea. The entire building was white, but inside the building the walls were covered with tiny green and blue tiles, giving an underwater feel. The middle court was reserved for sport activities. After crossing the court, we could go inside a building with multiple rooms made for all types of activities like fencing and swimming, as well as culinary classes and dance classes.
On the other side of the building, there were different courts for outside sports such as football, rugby, basketball, tennis and so on. The top-level court was where the second entrance was located, as well as the dormitories. The dormitories were large, ancient four-storey buildings decorated in what could only be described as an Italian style. The left side was for the boys, and the right side was for the girls. The dining room, library, study rooms and relaxation rooms, as well as playrooms, were all on the ground floor.
I had expected to find some greenery inside the walls, but it had exceeded my expectations. The most surprising thing about those trees was that some of them were fruit trees, but as we found out later, it was forbidden to pick any of them, and a biblical sin to eat any. The school headmaster himself had forbidden it, and many students had theorised at the time that he might have wanted to avoid a lawsuit in case of an accident happening.
Another thing I had noticed was that most of the day students were from Gateway Hill. Our school was a boarding school, but it obviously took in a lot of students from the village. As perfect-looking as the school was, there was something very strange about it. My mother was right; something was in the air. It was up to me to find out what.
I had felt a disturbance in the air as soon as I got to J.C., and every day since. As clean and fresh as the air was, it felt heavier on the skin than London’s, which was a lot more polluted. I could also feel a chill, as if I had landed in Mordor, and Sauron’s eye was watching me while sucking up the good energy that surrounded us.
I had expected to be sharing a room with my sister, but that was not the case. The rooms for students aged sixteen and over were for two students maximum. Although I was only fifteen, I was in the same grade as sixteen-year-old students, and ended up being placed on the same floor as them.
The room was small and a disappointment. There were two single beds, which did not make me happy, because I loved to roll around in my bed. The other annoying thing was the size of our cupboards – clearly, they did not intend for us to bring a lot of clothes. Although we would be wearing a uniform, no one would keep it on after classes.
The walls were magnolia, which made me happy, and we had been told that although we were not allowed to change anything in the room, we were allowed to put up posters and decorate as we wished, as long as we did not damage the original paint. There were also two small study desks with enough space for our laptops, and one window with a view onto the main court.
I would have been very upset, if my sister had not been on the next floor with girls of the same age and who seemed to be lovely. The younger girls were four per room and from ages twelve to fourteen. The décor was exactly the same as ours except that they had much bigger rooms and more cupboard space.
I was amazed by the dining room, and the menu we were offered was impressive. It was obvious that the place used to be a Catholic school, because the baroque style was not understated. The dining room had four arches painted in gold, and each arch had a different food station. The first was the meat station, the second was seafood, the third was salad and vegetables, and the last one was the sides and other accompaniments.
I had expected long tables like in Cambridge University colleges, but that was not the case. We instead had rectangular wooden tables next to each other. The room was vast, with a high ceiling painted in gold, and the doors were big dark wooden doors with red curtains. The floor was carpeted, and it was dark red like the curtains. Behind the curtains were very large sixteenth-century windows. A large table at the front of the room was reserved for the teachers, who got a sit-down meal.
I was about to complain that there was no dessert station when we were told by the other students that unlike other courses, the dessert station would be brought out later and was always a disappointment in taste and portion size.
Typical, I thought. As usual, my favourite part of the meal is the worst.
I wasn’t sitting with my sister, Amelia. She had chosen to sit with her new friends, so I sat by myself and was quickly joined by a familiar face. It was Hogan, a childhood friend of the family and a fellow Yan.
Hogan looked like what I expected James Bond had looked like as a teenager. He was tall and had olive skin like a Frenchman or an Italian, dark hair, dark eyes and a square jaw. He was considered to be quite handsome, and he knew it, which made him a bit fond of himself, but he was a very good person nevertheless.
I had never been so happy to see anyone in my life. I screamed and hugged him. Then I started pushing him and hitting him playfully. I couldn’t believe he had not told me that he was going to attend J.C. on the day of my goodbye party.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Hogan
He kept laughing and admitted that it had been a very hard secret to keep and that he had begged his parents not to tell mine that he would join Amelia and me, because he wanted to surprise me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Weatherford
I suddenly realised that Hogan’s mother had signed up her son to back me up in case I needed help, and he didn’t know anything about it.
I could only hope that he would not be too angry. Hogan was a Greek Yan. Greek Yans were Olympians, which meant that they worshipped Greek gods.
Their gods allowed them to dedicate a lot of their time to fun and parties but not much more, especially not towards preparing for unscheduled battles.
History had proven that not telling an Olympian in advance that he might be facing a battle was a very big mistake. I could only hope that when the time came, Hogan wouldn’t direct his anger towards me.
He introduced me to his roommate, named William. I was almost star-struck; he was the best-looking guy I had ever seen. He was gorgeous. If I hadn’t known better, I would have sworn that our god Thor himself was standing in front of me. He was tall, fair-skinned, muscular but not over the top, and had striking deep-blue eyes and long golden-blond hair. I was pretty sure that there were countries where being that good-looking was illegal.
To make matters worse, I couldn’t think of anything to say to him. I wanted to sound cool and relaxed, but everything was happening so fast, and the best I could do was to get up and give him my hand to shake. He took it and said, “Nice to meet you,” and we sat down. I nodded and gave him the world’s most forced smile. He smiled back and I almost fainted.
The boys’ dormitories were the same as the girls’, from what I understood, and it felt great to know that we would be able to hang out together quite often. It took two days for my roommate to arrive. Her name was Scarlett. When I first laid eyes on her, I was quite surprised; she looked like the Japanese manga character Georgie.
She was wearing a gorgeous grey-and-white autumn swing dress with short sleeves and two black strips, one under her chest and the other just over her hips, which made her waist look tiny despite her size-fourteen frame. She had very long blonde hair with big curls. She had big blue eyes, rosy cheeks, which were a little bit curvy, pink lips, a big smile and, uncommonly for a Masani girl as far as I had noticed since leaving Yanara, didn’t have make-up all over her face.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Scarlett
She was a bubbly and sweet girl, and we hit it off right away. I was over the moon; the sense of dread I’d felt when I had arrived at the school was completely gone. I was starting to feel that the year was going to be fantastic, and I was right; the school was starting to look like a primary school reunion to me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pam
I soon realised that Pam was two doors down from me. Pam and her brother Alex, most commonly known as Pam and Alex, were former classmates of Hogan and mine. Pam was a very good violinist, and Alex a talented pianist. Pam was a tall girl with long dark hair.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
She was one of the most beautiful girls in J.C.. She was actually so beautiful that every time we were on holiday in the Masani world, we would often get asked if we wanted to do modelling, or were given business cards by some photographer. In my case they would often say that I would be suitable as a plus-size model, which was ludicrous, since I was only a size twelve and considered quite small compared to the Yanara standard.
Pam’s twin, Alex, was very tall as well, and unlike me they were from Yanar City. Yanar City was our capital and was in the Pacific, and it was quite hot all year long, which meant that they were used to wearing almost nothing at all. In Yanara we said that southerners were wealthy because they never spent a penny on clothes except for swimwear, and, of course, as the good southerner that she was, here was Pam wearing a gorgeous light-brown floral-patterned short jumpsuit with a halter-neck and open back.
She looked stunning. I did not regret wearing my embroidered bohemian backless V-neck dress with long sleeves. I would have paled next to her otherwise.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Diana Amara Bouba Korsning
Pam’s roommate was a Masani girl named Farage1. I liked her immediately. She was short and curvy, not what you would call pretty, but she had a ton of charm. And when she smiled, her face lit up, and she suddenly started to look like the statue of Farage2 in Yanara, with a cheeky personality to go with it.
The school was great. The few students that we had really gotten to know were lovely people. I had updated Pam about our mission, but she agreed with my mother. She asked that we inform the boys only if it was strictly necessary, so that was what we did.
I was really starting to enjoy the Masani way of life. We knew so little about the Masani world, and everything sounded and looked so strange that we complained to other Yans.
We were advised by older Yans to watch something called “reality TV”. As shocking as it sounded, the Masanis, it seemed, documented every aspect of their lives and played it on air for anyone to see.
As entertaining as it was, I must admit that it did damage my opinion of the Masani culture slightly. Their reality television reinforced my belief that the Yan culture was far superior. After Scarlett and Farage1 discovered that we were watching reality TV as a reference to their culture, they were horrified.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
They both gave us a list of programmes to watch that would be more educational, as well as a list of movies, which became my favourite.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Diana Amara Bouba Korsning
In Yanar we did not have television or cinemas, and being introduced to it convinced me that the first thing to do in Yanar when I became duchess would be to introduce moving pictures to the duchy.
But in the meantime, as much as I had promised not to, I was still watching reality television, with my favourites being The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Counting On and MasterChef Australia.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
The honeymoon did not last long. A few weeks after we arrived, while in chemistry class, we heard a commotion. Teachers were called out of their classrooms and asked to go get help. We did not know why. I was terribly curious. What could have possibly been so bad that all the lecturers had to go off and run after who knew what?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Lecturer
Our lecturer came back in, and I thought that we were about to find out what happened, but all he said was that we were to be confined to our rooms. School was interrupted, and our parents were called, so instead of having a seriously good time gossiping, we had to promise them to behave and stay in our rooms.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Diana Amara Bouba Korsning
Salvation for my bruised curiosity came from Amelia, whose French class was opposite the scene of the commotion. I was worried about her, so I went and picked her up, which was when I got all the information I needed.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Amelia
A fourteen-year-old boy had climbed up one of the fruit trees and fallen and died. His name was Farage5. It did not take long for us to realise that it had become a media sensation. We learned that his father was deputy commissioner of Scotland Yard and that he had lost his mother a few years ago.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Diana Amara Bouba Korsning
The most troubling thing was that his mother, Farage6, had killed herself by jumping off a building. As much as I was sad for Mr Farage5, I couldn’t help but find the death of his son very troubling, especially as he had died from a fall as well.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Amelia
A few days later, Amelia came to find me in my room and told me that she was bothered by something she had found out about Farage5’s death. I shared with her my discomfort about the similarity between his and his mother’s deaths, and she agreed with me.
That afternoon, she told me that a student who had been sitting next to a window facing the tree from which Farage5 had fallen had seen a plastic bottle flying just before the fall. He hadn’t thought much about it at first, but after further thought, he had realised that Farage5 must have thrown it before his fall.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Diana Amara Bouba Korsning
Normally, I would have dismissed the information. The “witness” was none other than my sister’s friend Farage8, a horrible little troll with a very vivid imagination and a talent for putting his nose where it did not belong. But that information, if it was true, would add some serious juice to my theory that something very weird was going on in the school.
After a few enquiries, I realised that for the first time, Farage8 was right and had been telling the truth. Not only was he not the only one who had seen a bottle flying, but before we knew it, all sorts of rumours had started to fly around the school about Farage5’s death, and from what I could figure out, this was not the first time that the angel of death had visited our school.
It was, however, the first time that the dead student had been the child of a wealthy and influential person. It was as if a light had gone on in my head. My entire body was telling me, Yes, I knew it.
I knew something was off with the school, even if I still couldn’t say what, and I hadn’t seen any evidence of anyone doing anything, so why not concentrate on something else?
I decided to conduct my own investigation in order to validate or debunk the multiple rumours I had heard. The idea was tingling my body all over. I liked being in school, but I was starting to find life in a boarding school a bit dull and slow, so any new event was like Yule had come early for me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
I called Hogan after that and asked to meet with him after school. Although Hogan was a very sardonic person, he was also a very good friend and, just like me, loved playing Farage9 or Miss Marple, so I knew he wouldn’t make fun of me. To my dismay, he showed up with William. As soon as I saw them, I wanted to scream, “NOOOOOOOOOO!”<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
From the moment I had met William, my heart had stopped listening to me. Every time I got near him, my heart would start racing, my legs would go weak, and I would feel unwell. Unfortunately for me, he was always with Hogan, and with Hogan being a very good friend of mine, I had no choice but to endure being around William.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Things got a lot more complicated when Pam, Farage1, Scarlett and I attracted the attention of the resident popular mean girls of J.C. They would magically appear whenever we got together in main court, sitting under a tree, or in Gateway Hill, trying to enjoy ourselves.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
We shared a lot of classes with the mean girls, and for some reason, they would always find a way to sit behind us in class and make a point of the fact that we were the topic of their conversation.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
In Yanar we were not used to having our looks and behaviour criticised constantly. Most mean comments would usually be about our academic performances or fighting skills. Here the jibes felt very calculated. The girls would talk among themselves and say things like, ‘although we were quite beautiful, we most likely would not make many friends, because we gave off a vibe that suggested that we were snobbish and uptight’.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Diana Amara Bouba Korsning
They would also say that they couldn’t understand why Pam and I would want to be around fat and plain-Jane girls like Farage1 and Scarlett. They would add that they could only conclude that we had low self-esteem and that being around less attractive girls made Pam and me feel better about ourselves.
Those statements were cruel and unfounded. Scarlett was very cute, and Farage1 was as bright and sparkling as a star. And to be honest, Farage1 and Scarlett were much more attractive than they were, and after I had mentioned the comments to a few classmates, they agreed with me.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Pam
Most of the time, I wanted to get up and confront them, but Pam kept stopping me. She didn’t want to acknowledge their presence and believed that the biggest insult we could give them was our indifference.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Diana Amara Bouba Korsning
I disagreed. Farage1 might not have cared about what the girls were saying about her, but Scarlett did, and I had to console her in our room every day. If we had been in Yanar, I would have given the three bullies a well-deserved beating, and everyone around us would have applauded.
In the Masani world, however, violence was considered unacceptable, so Pam had made me swear not to hurt the bullies, and it was taking a lot of self-control on my part to listen to her and follow through with my promise.
I found out pretty quickly that the ring leader was William’s ex-girlfriend. The story around school was that they had ended their relationship right before school broke up last summer and that she had spent the entire summer taking selfies to remind him of what he was missing, but he had not shown any interest.
I was eventually shown the selfies she had plastered all over social media. The truth was that if I hadn’t been shown the selfies, I would have searched the internet myself after hearing all the buzz that those photos had generated at J.C..
I was ashamed to admit that I was dying to see the photos. As low as it might sound, I was secretly hoping that they would be embarrassing and make her look like a fool. When I was finally presented with them, they did not disappoint me at all.
The photos were quite raunchy and suggestive but nothing improper, and probably no one would have made a big deal about them if they had not been interpreted as being taken and posted in order to win back William. Because everyone had surmised that the selfies were posted as a message to William, they made her look desperate.
I have to admit that if I had taken that much time making myself look that sexy and beautiful, I would have been extremely frustrated to be ignored by the object of my affection. In all the pictures, her hair was flawless. I did find that she was wearing too much make-up, and she was pouting in all the selfies. Why? I had no idea, but otherwise, she looked super-hot.
In all her poses, she was wearing gorgeous bikinis. I recognised them as being Morena’s designs. Morena’s designs were very popular in Yanar because her aunt was a Yan from Wahine, a city in the south of the duchy.
In all the shots, her tan was perfect, and every pose showed her curves, especially her boobs and her derrière. Clearly, she had been hitting the gym as well, because her body was perfectly toned.
Just as Pam and I were about to ask my classmate what all the selfies could possibly have to do with the horrible way Farage1, Scarlett, Pam and I had been treated by the girls, we were told that after Pam and I had arrived at J.C., William had said, after seeing me and while standing next to his ex-girlfriend, “Wow! She is stunning.”
As soon as I heard that, I turned red, and Pam turned to me and gave me a smirk. She knew that I was very happy to hear that, but I had to pretend that I didn’t care. I didn’t want my classmate to know about my feelings for William.
I shrugged my shoulders and said, “Well, now I know why she hates me.”
So, seeing Hogan walking towards me to talk about the investigation, and realising that he had William with him, I was caught off guard. It would be the first time I saw him since I had learned that he found me attractive, and I didn’t know how to act around him.
My other worry was that as much as William had been hanging around Hogan since school started, he had been attending J.C. since he was twelve years old, like seventy per cent of the students there. That meant that by the time we arrived, most students had already been divided into cliques, and William’s ex-girlfriend Pollard was part of his clique, which meant that they were destined to spend a lot of time together.
Not wanting to let my feelings get in the way of a good mystery, I mentioned my suspicions to the boys, and all that I had been told by Amelia. The boys didn’t have much time to chit-chat, but they promised to get back to me by the weekend.
Seeing William just reminded me that I had a problem named Pollard. I knew I was obsessing too much about her, but when we had first arrived at J.C., we were warned about the worst bullies at the school, and her name was mentioned.
We had heard from Farage1 and Scarlett that the previous year, a student had attempted suicide because of Pollard and her friends’ incessant bullying, which had caused the student to leave J.C. and William to break up with her.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
The three girls were also arrested for bullying, which carried a six-month community sentence, as well as a fifteen-thousand-pound fine to the victim from each girl. The victim’s family also took out a restraining order against the girls, and they all had a criminal record.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Diana Amara Bouba Korsning
The gods have been generous was all I could think. I was glad that bullying was taken as seriously in the UK as it was in Yanar.
It did not take me long to realise that my chances to ever be with William were from zero to none. I was convinced that with a reputation like hers, there was little chance Pollard wouldn’t spoil any attempt of mine to approach the boy she liked.
Because Hogan had become so close to William, we had started to spend time with William as well. The result was that William’s other friends got into the habit of joining us. It was obvious that even though they were no longer a couple, they still belonged to the same group of friends, so it seemed like they were always together, and she was acting as if he still belonged to her.
I started to dread having to spend time with Hogan and William. I knew that spending time with them meant spending time with his ex-girlfriend, and I really didn’t like her.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
In all fairness we were also a clique, and by we I meant the Yans of the same age group. There were six of us: Hogan, Tristan, Pam, Alex, Hassan and me. Hassan’s real name was David, but anyone who grew up with him called him Hassan because he always compared himself to Hassan, a famous gladiator in Yanar.
Although people knew about the existence of Yans in the world, besides our embassies and a few publicly know official Yan institutions, they couldn’t tell the difference between a Yan and one of them.
The students certainly didn’t know that there were any Yan students in J.C., but our attitude and our cluelessness towards simple Masani ways of life had started to make them suspect us of being Yans.
Little things, like a simple introduction in a social gathering, were totally different in Yanar. In Yanar asking a stranger for their name or where they were from was extremely rude. Until a person volunteered the information, no one could ask them for it.
What Yans did was introduce themselves and hope that the other person reciprocated. If it didn’t happen, then the message was clear: they had no interest in striking up a conversation with you.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Yan students
When we had arrived in J.C., the students had kept asking for our name and where we were from. We took it as an insult, and it resulted in a lot of verbal arguments, to the point where they all stopped asking and waited to be approached by us.
The other thing was our lack of knowledge when it came to music or movies or even popular hang-outs. It was pretty clear to them that wherever we were from, it was very removed from what they called “the civilised world”.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>Narrator
Despite our shortcomings, it did not take us long to become popular in J.C., but not for the same reasons as in a Yan school.
Being popular in a Yan school was not the same as being popular in a Masani school. In Yan schools, popularity was based on your academic and FIST performances; students became popular only after gaining the highest distinction intellectually and in FIST, and for nothing else.
People like William and his friends, who were popular because they were good-looking and had a chance to go to the Olympics or make a national team, had no value in Yan schoolyard hierarchy.<|im_end|>
